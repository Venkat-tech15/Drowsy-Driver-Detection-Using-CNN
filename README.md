## 🚗💤 Drowsy Driver Detection using CNN

### Overview
Driving while drowsy can be extremely dangerous and is a major cause of road accidents. 🛑 To tackle this issue, our **Drowsy Driver Detection** system is designed to monitor driver alertness in real-time and detect signs of drowsiness using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. 🧠✨

By analyzing a driver’s facial features through a camera, this system can recognize signs of fatigue and help prevent potential accidents before they happen. 🚦

---

### 📦 Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: The system uses a camera feed to constantly monitor the driver’s face for signs of drowsiness, such as drooping eyelids. 👁️
- **CNN-Based Model**: Built using a powerful CNN architecture, the model can detect drowsiness with high accuracy by processing facial features. 🖥️📊
- **Pre-trained Model**: The system is backed by a pre-trained model that has been trained on large datasets of images to recognize drowsiness patterns. 🧑‍💻

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Image Capture**: A camera is used to capture frames of the driver’s face in real-time. 🎥
2. **CNN Analysis**: These frames are passed through a CNN model, which has been trained to detect whether the driver is drowsy. The model analyzes the position of the driver’s eyes and facial expressions. 🖼️🔍
3. **Alert System**: If drowsiness is detected, the system immediately triggers an alert to wake the driver up and prevent accidents. 🚨
